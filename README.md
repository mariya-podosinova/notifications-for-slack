# Automated Event Notifications in Slack from Outlook Calendar

## Overview

This project seeks to bridge the gap between Microsoft Outlook Calendar and Slack, allowing users to effortlessly sync and share calendar events with their Slack teams. Our specific focus is on integrating 'Manchester Events' from Outlook Calendar and sending automated updates to Slack channels every week.

Previously, our implementation involved integrating Google Calendar with Slack. However, to meet the evolving needs of our team, we now aim to create a new integration with Outlook Calendar. By leveraging the power of automation, we intend to eliminate the need for manual event sharing and ensure that important 'Manchester Events' updates are seamlessly communicated within Slack channels. Our goal is to create a more connected and efficient work environment.

## Project Status

### Recent Developments

This week, our project focused on the operational aspect, primarily securing access to Power Automate, a critical component of our integration plan. Key activities and achievements include:

- **Communication with Support**: We initiated communication with the support team to resolve access-related issues by opening tickets with Accenture Support, ensuring necessary permissions for our project.

- **Resolution of Initial Issues**: Collaborative efforts with the support team successfully resolved initial challenges, ensuring seamless access to Power Automate.

- **Logging a New Request**: We streamlined integration efforts by logging a new request with Power Intake, ensuring access to required tools and resources.

## Requirements

1. **Automated Notifications from Outlook Calendar to Specified Slack Channels**:

   - The system should automate the process of sending notifications from Outlook Calendar to specified Slack channels.
   - Users should have the ability to customize the content and format of notifications, including setting notification frequency and other preferences, such as setting it to every Friday for all events for the following week.
   - Notifications should be sent automatically when new events are added to the Outlook Calendar or when changes are made to calendar events by the owner, ensuring timely updates in the Slack channel.

2. **User Documentation and UAT**:
   - Provide user documentation or guides explaining how to set up and use the integration.
   - Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to validate that notifications are accurate, timely, and meet user expectations.

## Current Progress

### Exploratory Phase

During the previous weeks, our primary focus was on the exploratory phase of our project. Key activities during this phase included:

- **Research and Evaluation**: We conducted comprehensive research and evaluation of potential integration approaches, aiming to identify the most suitable method for seamless integration.

- **Solution Discovery**: The exploratory phase involved discovering and assessing multiple integration options to determine the optimal path forward. We evaluated feasibility, benefits, and challenges associated with each solution.

## Available Solutions

### Overview

We've explored several potential solutions for integrating Outlook Calendar with Slack, with a primary focus on leveraging Power Automate due to its compatibility and advantages. Below, we outline the available options, along with their associated considerations.

### Solution 1: Third-Party Tools Providers (Low Priority)

üëç No need to develop a custom solution.
üëé Not free, which can add to project costs.

### Solution 2: Application Development with Microsoft Developer (Medium Priority)

üëç Total control over implementation, allowing for custom features.
üëé Requires development effort and resources; no access right now.

### Solution 3: Reusing Templates with Power Automate (High Priority)

üëç Access to a repository of ready-made templates and a large community.
üëé No access right now.

### Solution 4: Creating a Slack Bot (Low Priority)

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è More research is needed to gather details and feasibility as we don't have sufficient information at the moment.
