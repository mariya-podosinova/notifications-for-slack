# Automated Event Notifications in Slack from Outlook Calendar

## Overview

This project seeks to bridge the gap between Microsoft Outlook Calendar and Slack, allowing users to effortlessly sync and share calendar events with their Slack teams. Our specific focus is on integrating 'Manchester Events' from Outlook Calendar and sending automated updates to Slack channels every week.

Previously, our implementation involved integrating Google Calendar with Slack. However, to meet the evolving needs of our team, we now aim to create a new integration with Outlook Calendar. By leveraging the power of automation, we intend to eliminate the need for manual event sharing and ensure that important 'Manchester Events' updates are seamlessly communicated within Slack channels. Our goal is to create a more connected and efficient work environment.

## Project Status

### Recent Developments

This week, our project focused on the operational aspect, primarily securing access to Power Automate, a critical component of our integration plan. Key activities and achievements include:

- **Communication with Support**: We initiated communication with the support team to resolve access-related issues by opening tickets with Accenture Support, ensuring necessary permissions for our project.

- **Resolution of Initial Issues**: Collaborative efforts with the support team successfully resolved initial challenges, ensuring seamless access to Power Automate.

- **Logging a New Request**: We streamlined integration efforts by logging a new request with Power Intake, ensuring access to required tools and resources.
