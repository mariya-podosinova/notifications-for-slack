# Automated Event Notifications in Slack from Outlook Calendar

## Overview

This project seeks to bridge the gap between Microsoft Outlook Calendar and Slack, allowing users to effortlessly sync and share calendar events with their Slack teams. Our specific focus is on integrating 'Manchester Events' from Outlook Calendar and sending automated updates to Slack channels every week.

Previously, our implementation involved integrating Google Calendar with Slack. However, to meet the evolving needs of our team, we now aim to create a new integration with Outlook Calendar. By leveraging the power of automation, we intend to eliminate the need for manual event sharing and ensure that important 'Manchester Events' updates are seamlessly communicated within Slack channels. Our goal is to create a more connected and efficient work environment.

## Project Status

### Recent Developments

This week, our focus was on the operational aspect of our project. We have been actively engaged in the process of securing access to Power Automate, a critical component of our integration plan. The following key activities took place:

- **Communication with Support**: We initiated communication with the support team to address and resolve access-related issues. This involved opening tickets with Accenture. Support to ensure the necessary permissions for our project.

- **Resolution of Initial Issues**: The collaborative effort with the support team led to the successful resolution of the initial issues we encountered. We have made significant progress in ensuring smooth access to Power Automate.

- **Logging a New Request**: To further streamline our integration efforts, we proceeded by logging a new request with Power Intake. This proactive step ensures that we have all the required tools and resources at our disposal.

### Exploratory Phase

In the preceding week, our primary focus was on the exploratory phase of our project. During this phase, we were dedicated to investigating various solution options for the integration of Outlook Calendar with Slack. The key activities included:

- **Research and Evaluation**: We conducted thorough research and evaluation of potential integration approaches. Our goal was to identify the most suitable and efficient method for achieving seamless integration.

- **Solution Discovery**: The exploratory phase involved discovering and considering multiple options to determine the optimal path forward. We assessed the feasibility, benefits, and challenges associated with each solution.
