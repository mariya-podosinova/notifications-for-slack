Hi Digital Worker,

As you may know, Power Platform's mission is to build a secure path for every Accenture citizen to create their own solutions that can consume data from core services.

In your request, you selected Slack connector(s) which is/are currently unavailable within Accenture. This connector would need to undergo our evaluation process to get approval to enable. This process typically takes ~6-8 weeks to complete, and the answer could be to either keep the connector blocked or enable for use within Accenture.

If you would like for us to begin the evaluation process, please let us know otherwise we will keep the connector blocked. Additional to these please with us details about which you’re trying to use with this connector. It would also be helpful if you could let us know how many users you expect to use your solution, and your business justification for using this blocked connector.

In the meantime, check out the Power Guide Application and the Citizen Development Yammer page for the most up to date information.

Best Regards,
CIO Power Platform Team

Hi, I'm attempting to reuse an existing template on the Power Automate platform titled 'Post to Slack when an upcoming event is starting soon in Outlook Calendar.' However, I encountered an error, and I've attached a screenshot for reference. I'm unsure about the next steps. Accenture support advised me to log a request with you. Can you assist me with this?

Hi Digital Worker,

To understand which is the best alternative for your case, we must have more information:

Please can you provide a solution architecture diagram and explanation of what you are trying to achieve? Please refer to this blog for more info on how to create one.
Please update the Connectors field in your use case with all the connectors you intend to use in your solution. (Just Slack?)
Where do you sit in the organization?​ CIO or non-CIO app?​  
If CIO, roughly how many users and what teams are going to be using your solution?  
Will your solution be connecting to Workday, ServiceNow, MyTE or any other central CIO app?
If applicable, which environment is your solution currently in?
Are you planning to use any sensitive, personal, or restricted data?
If YES, you’d need to register in AIR here.
For a full check list of whether you’ll definitely need an AIR ID, please refer to Slide Do I Need an AIR ID from the Customer Journey Guide.
Will you require any development and architecture help from the Central Power Platform team?
Best Regards,
CIO Power Platform Team
